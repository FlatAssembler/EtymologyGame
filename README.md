# EtymologyGame
A web-game about historical linguistics.

This is a web-game that simulates phonological developments of two related imaginary languages and makes tasks based on that. It can be seen live here: http://flatassembler.000webhostapp.com/etymologist.html

"etymologist.html" uses JQuery, advanced CSS and basic SVG to create a graphic interface, but it, of course, doesn't work in all browsers.

"etymology.html" creates a text-based interface, and it works in browsers which don't support advanced web-technologies, such as Internet Explorer 6 and NetSurf.
